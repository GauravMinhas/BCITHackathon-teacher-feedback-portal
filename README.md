Project Summary:
Given roughly 30 hours for development, and grouped with co-op students we had never met before, 
we were tasked with developing something that would benefit BCIT students. 
We created an online web application that streamlined teacher evaluations, 
as currently they are provided to us in scantron format which a waste of paper and other management resources.

Students would be able to login with their student_id number and password and a list of their current classes would automatically be populated. The classes with feedback already given not be clickable to prevent multiple entries

Clicking on the option would bring them to a survey form that they can fill out and leave comments in. 
Once submitted, they would no longer be able to submit another.

Teachers would be able to login with their id numbers and passwords and view all their current courses. 
Clicking on a course would take them to the page that displays all submitted survey data from students.
 
We designed the database in such a manner that no one will be able to tell the owner of the feedback, once it has been given. This makes the process totally anonymous.
